# PersonalFinanceTracking
An Simple app that reminds you of your personal finance. Specifically, track what you owe to others or vice-versa.

This is my first time working on a real project in flutter.

So, first I begin by finding useful UI Designs for an basic idea of what should my app UI should look like.

After preview of different random UI designs, I have something in my brain but won't be wasting my time creating the design, let's jump directly to creating the app. UI can be improved later on.

<b> Starting the Project </b>

Open a direcotory on your system and create a new folder.
run CMD ( In windows ) and type the command "flutter create your_app_name_here ". and execute it.
use cd command to change your directory to the your_app_name_here directory and execute the command "code ."
this will open your project in VS code.
